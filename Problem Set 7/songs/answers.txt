Reflection of the question number 1:
After analizing data we see that the average energy of music is 0.659, average valence of music is 0.484
and average danceability of music is 0.716. So we can say that the user listens to both happy and sad music and
the user's Aura Hue is blue.

Reflection of the question number 2:
A better way to calculate this Aura would be to use more data from what the user is listening to.
